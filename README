What is SameSame?
=================

SameSame is a collection of tools that fall in to the category of file
management software. These tools will prevent that you need todelete
files or buy more disk space. Instead they solve low disk space problems
by linking identical files together and thus free up waisted disk space.

This collection was inspired by the application samefile written by Jens
Schweikhardt. The collection comes with its own version of samefile that
is noticeable faster and is able to process a much larger file list.
Samefile is the duplicate file finder and combined with samelink it acts
as a duplicate file remover.

This port contains the applications: samefile, samelink and samearchive.
The latter does the same as samefile but for file-based archives. The
port also contains a version that uses just 10% of the resources
compared to samearchive. The application samelink hard link identical
files for you.

Typical usage would be:

   find / | samefile -i | samelink.

This would search for identical files and clean up wasted disk space by
linking them together. Add the option -vn after samelink for a verbose
dry-run.
